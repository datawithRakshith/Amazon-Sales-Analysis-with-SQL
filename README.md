# Amazon-Sales-Analysis-with-SQL


## Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to analyze Amazonâ€™s sales data to understand the various factors influencing overall performance. By studying sales patterns across different dimensions such as customer behavior and product categories, we aim to identify key trends and generate actionable insights for business users. These insights will help Amazon make informed decisions to optimize operations, improve product offerings, and increase profitability.

## Data:

This dataset contains sales transactions from three different branches of Amazon, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows:

### Column	Description:

## 1.Data Wrangling:
This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure NULL values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace missing or NULL values.

### 1.1 Build a database
The project starts by creating a database named `project`.
```sql
create database project;
```
### 1.2 Create a table and insert the data.
A table named amazon is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns which are mentioned above.
```sql

create table amazon
(
invoiceid VARCHAR(30) primary key,
branch VARCHAR(5),
city varchar(30),
customer_type varchar(30),
gender varchar(10),
productline varchar(100),
unitprice decimal(10,2),
quantity int,
vat FLOAT(6, 4),
total decimal(10, 2),
date date,
time timestamp,
paymentmethod decimal(10,2),
cogs decimal(10,2),
grossmarginpercentage float(11,9),
grossincome decimal(10,2),
rating float(2,1)
);
```

### 1.3 NULL value check
In table amazon, check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
**Checking null values:** Retrieve all rows from the amazon table where any column contains NULL values using the IS NULL condition.
```sql
SELECT * FROM amazon
WHERE 
    invoice_id IS NULL
    OR branch IS NULL
    OR city IS NULL
    OR customer_type IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR product_line IS NULL
    OR unit_price IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR VAT IS NULL
    OR total IS NULL
    OR date IS NULL
    OR time IS NULL
    OR payment_method IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR gross_margin_percentage IS NULL
    OR gross_income IS NULL
    OR rating IS NULL;
```

**Deleting null values:** Remove all rows from the amazon table where any column contains NULL values by using the DELETE command combined with the IS NULL condition for each relevant column.

```sql
delete FROM amazon
WHERE 
    invoice_id IS NULL
    OR branch IS NULL
    OR city IS NULL
    OR customer_type IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR product_line IS NULL
    OR unit_price IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR VAT IS NULL
    OR total IS NULL
    OR date IS NULL
    OR time IS NULL
    OR payment_method IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR gross_margin_percentage IS NULL
    OR gross_income IS NULL
    OR rating IS NULL;
```

## 2. Feature Engineering:
This process allows us to create new columns by deriving them from existing data, helping to enhance the dataset for deeper analysis.

### 2.1 Add Time of Day Column
A new column named timeofday is added to categorize sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. This helps in identifying which part of the day records the highest number of sales.

```sql
alter table amazon
add column timeofday varchar(20);

UPDATE amazon
SET timeofday = CASE
    WHEN TIME(time) BETWEEN '10:00:00' AND '12:59:59' THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN TIME(time) BETWEEN '13:00:00' AND '16:59:59' THEN 'Afternoon'
    WHEN TIME(time) BETWEEN '17:00:00' AND '20:59:59' THEN 'Evening'
    ELSE 'Other'
END;
```

### 2.2 Add Day Name Column
A new column named dayname is created to extract the day of the week (e.g., Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) on which each transaction occurred. This helps determine which day of the week each branch experiences the highest customer activity.

```sql
alter table amazon
add column dayname varchar(15);

update amazon
set dayname=dayname(date);
```

### 2.3 Add Month Name Column
A new column named monthname is added to extract the month (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar) of each transaction. This helps analyze which month of the year generated the most sales and profit.

```sql
alter table amazon
add column monthname varchar(15);

update amazon
set monthname=monthname(date);
```

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to gain insights from the dataset and to address the problem statement and business questions outlined in this project.**
**The main objective is to analyze sales patterns across different branches, product lines, and customer segments in order to identify key factors that drive revenue and profit.**
**This analysis will help the business make data-driven decisions related to sales strategies, customer targeting, and inventory planning.**
