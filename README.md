# Amazon-Sales-Analysis-with-SQL


## Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to analyze Amazonâ€™s sales data to understand the various factors influencing overall performance. By studying sales patterns across different dimensions such as customer behavior and product categories, we aim to identify key trends and generate actionable insights for business users. These insights will help Amazon make informed decisions to optimize operations, improve product offerings, and increase profitability.

## Data:

This dataset contains sales transactions from three different branches of Amazon, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows:

## 1.Data Wrangling:
This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure NULL values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace missing or NULL values.

### 1.1 Build a database
The project starts by creating a database named `project`.
```sql
create database project;
```
### 1.2 Create a table and insert the data.
A table named amazon is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns which are mentioned above.
```sql

create table amazon
(
invoiceid VARCHAR(30) primary key,
branch VARCHAR(5),
city varchar(30),
customer_type varchar(30),
gender varchar(10),
productline varchar(100),
unitprice decimal(10,2),
quantity int,
vat FLOAT(6, 4),
total decimal(10, 2),
date date,
time timestamp,
paymentmethod decimal(10,2),
cogs decimal(10,2),
grossmarginpercentage float(11,9),
grossincome decimal(10,2),
rating float(2,1)
);
```

### 1.3 NULL value check
In table amazon, check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
**Checking null values:** Retrieve all rows from the amazon table where any column contains NULL values using the IS NULL condition.
```sql
SELECT * FROM amazon
WHERE 
    invoice_id IS NULL
    OR branch IS NULL
    OR city IS NULL
    OR customer_type IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR product_line IS NULL
    OR unit_price IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR VAT IS NULL
    OR total IS NULL
    OR date IS NULL
    OR time IS NULL
    OR payment_method IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR gross_margin_percentage IS NULL
    OR gross_income IS NULL
    OR rating IS NULL;
```

**Deleting null values:** Remove all rows from the amazon table where any column contains NULL values by using the DELETE command combined with the IS NULL condition for each relevant column.

```sql
delete FROM amazon
WHERE 
    invoice_id IS NULL
    OR branch IS NULL
    OR city IS NULL
    OR customer_type IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR product_line IS NULL
    OR unit_price IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR VAT IS NULL
    OR total IS NULL
    OR date IS NULL
    OR time IS NULL
    OR payment_method IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR gross_margin_percentage IS NULL
    OR gross_income IS NULL
    OR rating IS NULL;
```
